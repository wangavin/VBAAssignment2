# Module 2 Challenge - Multiple Year Stock.

This Project Challenge your VBA Script writing and organize.  The idea is training your thinking and planning for the script from your Table Reference.

# Planning and Organizing

My first step is planning which reference Data easy for script pick up and east locate the reference location. 

Second is going to find out Formula for Year Change, Percent Change and Total Stock Volume.

Third is organizing how to start write VBA script. My idea is start for create Tittle. Look at ticker name from year start to the end.  Use my find out Formula to fill answer Year Change, Percent Change and Total Stock Volume.

Fourth is following my planning how to use the VBA script looping for all answer on the Sheet and how to continue place answer on other Sheet in same VBA scripting. 

# Used VBA Script
